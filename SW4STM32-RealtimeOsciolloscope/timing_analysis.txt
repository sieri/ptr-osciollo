task 6

Requirement
1. ADC conversion with 1kHz or more
2. Screen Refreshrate 20 to 60 hz

Question 1.
	Is it possible to run number 1 with a xf
	
	time for the aquisition is mostly managed by the hardware, 
	the xf would likely have to answer to one event every at least 0.5ms (2*1kHz per Shannon theorem) this is tight but definitely possible, and an RTOS wouldn't help here, 
	given all events at that speed would be in the same task, a priority based XF could improve performances more	
	
Question 2.
	Is it possible to run number 2 with a xf	
	
	time of draw is quite significant, but spaced enough a xf shouldn't have an issue.  
	
Question 3.
	If combined with a hardware timer with an XF which need to be prioritized
	
	The hardware timer, it can interupt the processing of the event and run things like aquisition of the ADC with minumum process necessary. 
	The ADC is also the most time critical part of the system. Display delay cause less problem than aquisition of the waveform.

Question 1:
 how many sample/s needed for 1kHz, at least 2000 per Shannon theorem.
 
Question 2: 
 an Antiliasing filter would be useful, filtering at the maximum sampling frequency possible if the generation wasn't controlled. But given how it's setup it's not necessary
 
Question 3: 
	frequency should be higher if possible for better representation of non sine signals.
	
Question 4:
	PA0 is the connected to the ADC IN0 channel (shared between all three ADCs
	
Question 5:
	ADC can be triggered by an timer, or with continuous mode where it runs after each conversion is done after the last one.
